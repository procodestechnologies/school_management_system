/**
 * student_details.parent_id holds a users.id everywhere in this codebase -
 * StudentDetails::where('parent_id', $user->id), the Parent role's scoping,
 * report card delivery, the student form. The column, however, was declared
 * NOT NULL and foreign-keyed to parent_details.id.
 *
 * Two consequences, both real: a student could not be enrolled without a
 * parent at all, and enrolling one *with* a parent only worked when the new
 * parent_details row happened to be handed the same id as the parent's user
 * row. Any mismatch was a foreign key violation.
 *
 * The conservative repair is to drop the constraint and let the column be
 * null: no data is touched, existing rows keep their values, and the column
 * now means what the whole application already assumes it means. Adding a
 * users foreign key instead is the eventual tidy-up - it can't be done here
 * without first proving every existing value resolves to a user.
