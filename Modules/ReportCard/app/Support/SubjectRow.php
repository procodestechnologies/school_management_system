 * One line of a report card's subject table.
 *
 * A learner sits a subject more than once in a term (a mid-term paper and
 * an end-term one), and the report states the subject once. `marks` and
 * `outOf` are therefore the term's totals for that subject, and
 * `percentage` is worked out from those totals rather than by averaging
 * the individual papers - so a 40-mark paper counts for twice as much as a
 * 20-mark one, which is what a school means by a subject's score.
 *
 * A row with no papers at all is still built, so the report shows every
 * subject the class takes and says plainly which were not assessed instead
 * of quietly leaving them off.
